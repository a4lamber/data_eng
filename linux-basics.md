## Basics

### The linux Filesystem

Some buzzwords

`Binaries` refers to files that can be executed, generally reside in `/usr/bin`



### Basic Commands

- `pwd` stands for printing working diretory and returns the filepath you are at
- `whoami` returns the username
- `cd` 
  - `.` means current directory, so `cd .` does nothing, but `cd ..` changes the directory to the partent one. 
- `ls` returns contents of a directory including files and subdirectories
  - `ls /Users` returns contents in the dicrectory `/Users` 
  - `ls -l` to do a long listing (`-l` stands for long)
  - `ls -la` to see hidden file

- `locate` and `whereis`

>Tips: The convention in linux is to use a double dash `--` before word option, such as `--help`, and a single dash `-` before single-letter options, such as `-h`
